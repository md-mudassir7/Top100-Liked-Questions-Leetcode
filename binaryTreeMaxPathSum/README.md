Approach

    1.The maximum path sum of any node in the tree is the maximum of 3 values (path which includes the current node,
    
    path which starts from the current node and the path which does not include the current node)

    2.We recursively call for the left and right subtrees and keep track of the maximum path so far and return it at the end

    3.The below image gives a clear understanding
