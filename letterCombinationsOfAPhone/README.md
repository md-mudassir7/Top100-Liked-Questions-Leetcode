Approach

    1.Create a map of number and alphabets belonging to that number in phonepad

    2.For every character in the string update the res using map 


Dry Run

    String = '23'

    res={""}

    1st iteration

        char = '2' and map value(curr) = 'abc'

        res = {'a','b','c'}

    2nd iteration

        char = '3' and map value(curr) = 'def'

        res = {'ad','bd','cd'} for char 'd' and similarly for e and f the result is calculated using the 2 for loops running
