Approach

    1.Since it is given that there is only one duplicate number we can use indexing method to calculate it as we know

    all numbers are in range 1 to n+1

    2.We can negate the value at the index which is equal to current number and if that value is already negative that 

    means the current number is a duplicate number hence we return it

    3.Code gives a clear understanding
