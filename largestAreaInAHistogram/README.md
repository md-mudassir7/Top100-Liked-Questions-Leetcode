Approach

    1.The approach uses the concept of next smaller element in an array which can be solved using stack

    2.We find the next smaller and previous smaller element for all the array and store them in 2 vectors

    3.For every element the maximum area is equal to the product of length and width of the rectangle it can extend upto

    4.Length is the height of the current element while width is the difference between next smaller and previous smaller element of the array
