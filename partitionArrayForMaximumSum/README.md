Approach

    1.Our approach here is to find out maximum sum till a given index. 
    
    2.We can do this by finding maxelement till that index and replacing array elements with it ( here, we will replace only atmost K elements) ,for that we require another for loop , in this way , we can find that maxsum upto that index and store it in our dp array.
