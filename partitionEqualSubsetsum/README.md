Approach

    1.The approach is similar to subset sum problem

    2.We calculate the sum of array and if sum is odd then its sure that we cannot divide it into equal subsets

    3.If the sum is even then the problem boils down to subset sum problem with sum = sum/2 or original array

    4.The code gives better understanding
