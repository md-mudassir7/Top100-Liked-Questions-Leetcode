Approach

    1.Use two Linked list variables pre and next

    2.At any point of time next stores the node next to head and pre stores the node previous to head

    3.Assign the next of head to pre to reverse the pointer

    4.Assign pre to head first and head to next in next line

    5.Return pre after completely traversing the list
