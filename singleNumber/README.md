Approach

    1.We know xor of any element with itself is 0 

    2.And xor of any number with 0 is the number itself

    3.Since all the other elements are appearing twice when they are xored with each other they leave 0

    4.And the elemen which is single is xored with 0 and results itself

    5.Hence the answer is the xor of all elements in the array
