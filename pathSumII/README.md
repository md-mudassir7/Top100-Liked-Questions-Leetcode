Approach

    1.The same approach used for pathSum1

    2.Here we have to find all the root->leaf paths which add to the targetsum

    3.Passing the temp array without reference is an important thing to do as it only includes the shortest path from root to current node 

    when we are at a particular node


    4.The code gives better understanding
