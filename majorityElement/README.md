Approach

    1.Boyer moores voting algorithm

    2.Initialise 2 variables majorityElement(which is our answer) and a count = 0

    3.If the current number in array is equal to majorityElement increase count by 1

    4.If its not decrease the count by 1

    5.At last the value stored in majorityElement will be our answer,return it

    6.Dry run the algorithm for multiple test cases for clear understanding
