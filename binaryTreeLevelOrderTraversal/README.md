Approach

    1.Use queue

    2.In every iteration the queue contains all the elements of that particular level

    3.We keep adding the values of nodes in queue to a temporary vector for a particular level

    4.Then we add the temporary vector to our result

    5.In this way after all the levels are processed we return our result
