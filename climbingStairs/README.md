1st approach

    1.Uses extra space for storing results at each step

    2.At any point total number of ways to reach this point = ways to reach point-1 + ways to reach point-2 which are already calculated

2nd approach

    1.Uses variable instead of array to store previous 2 results

    2.current result = sum of preivous 2 variables

    3.Updated previous 2 variables
