Approach

    1.Declare 2 maps one mpt for storing the frequency of character of string t and mps for string s

    2.Initialise a variable matchCount to count whether we have got all the characters of string t in string s

    3.run a while loop until all the characters 

    4.In the while loop first start aquiring the characters for our substring and If the acquired character is matched, increased the matchCount

    5.Once all characters of string t are found in a substring of s start releasing the characters from the left and find a Potential answer(temp in the code)

    6.If size of potential answer is less than answer, update the answer

    7.If the released character is matched, decreased the count
