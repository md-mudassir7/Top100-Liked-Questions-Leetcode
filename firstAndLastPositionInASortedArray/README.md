Approach

    1.Use binary search

    2.to calculate first occurence binary search on the array and if mid is target then assign the right pointer to mid-1

    as we are trying to find the first occurence of number which has probability of existence in left side of mid element

    3.Similarly for last occurence assign left pointer to mid+1
