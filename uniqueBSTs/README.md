Approach

    1.For any number(n) the total number of trees are equal to the trees formed by taking root as all numbers between (1,n)

    2.For example ans for n = 4 is equal to sum of answers generated by taking root as 1,2,3,4 hence the inner for loop

    3.To calculate trees for n = 3 we multiply all the trees formed by its left(1,2) and right(4) part since it is a BST
