Approach

    1.For any number(n) the total number of trees are equal to the trees formed by taking root as all numbers between (1,n)

    2.For example ans for n = 4 is equal to sum of answers generated by taking root as 1,2,3,4 hence the inner for loop

    3.To calculate trees for n = 3 we multiply all the trees formed by its left(1,2) and right(4) part since it is a BST


Dry Run

    For n = 3 we can create bst's with node 1 ,2 and 3

    If we take node 1 then we have   1          and    1           (both 2 and 3 lie on right part of tree)
                                      \                 \
                                       2                 3
                                        \               /
                                         3             2

     If we take node 2 then we have  2                             (1 lies in the left and 3 lies on right part of tree)
                                    / \         
                                   1   3         
                                        
     If we take node 3 then we have  3          and     3          (both 1 and 2 lie on left part of tree)
                                    /                  /
                                   1                  2
                                    \                /
                                     2              1

    
    Hence we get 5 number of trees
