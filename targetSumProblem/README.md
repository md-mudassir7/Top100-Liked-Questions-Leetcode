Approach

    1.Every element in the array has 2 choices i.e it can be assigned a '+' or a '-' sign

    2.Hence we can partition the array into 2 sets one set of elements will have a '+' and other set will have a '-' sign

    3.Hence we are required to find the number of subsets whose difference is the target

    4.So this problem boils down to finding the number of subsets with difference equal to target
