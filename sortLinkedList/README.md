Approach

    1.Similar to merge sort in arrays but the problem is to find mid of list everytime

    2.To find the mid of linked list in optimal way we use 2 pointer method fast and slow 

    and recursively call for every half of list

    3.To merge 2 lists we use mergeSortedLists approach which merges our 2 halves into a single sorted list


Find mergeSortedLists [here](sortLinkedList/)
